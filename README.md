# Journal Application


This journal application will be a collection of
what people want to keep track of, including 
recording a collection of dates people want to 
remember, how much money they spent and have 
left in their account. *Anyone* can use it.

Many people prefer to type than write nowadays, 
so I thought of making an electronic journal.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add an entry
to the journal.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of dates
I have an entry on.
- As a user, I want to be able to select existing date
in journal and view page in detail.
- As a user, I want to be able to keep track of spending history.

- As a user, I want to be able to save the journal state
- As a user, I want to be able to open my journal and 
resume from the state it was left in.


##Phase 4: Task 2

An entry was added to Journal.

##Phase 4: Task 3
